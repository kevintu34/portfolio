      <p>
        After graduating college with a degree in business administration for accounting, I worked as an accountant in the digital marketing space for six years. During my time as an accountant, I found myself more attracted to creative and problem solving endeavors so I taught myself some code while working but never fully pursued it. Now, I have decided to fully jump in and start my coding journey with Thinkful.

        Outside of my profession, I love illustrating and playing videos. I can often be found in front of my computer playing different genres of games or in front of my iPad, sketching away.

      <p>
        Please feel free to reach out to me for anything coding related, whether it be job prospects, project collaboration, or if you just want to talk! I love speaking and listening to other people's passions and interests and who knows, maybe we will build the next best thing since sliced bread.
